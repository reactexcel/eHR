## Application Structure

The application structure presented below is to be strictly followed while developing the the application. The functionality is grouped in to modules based on its feature and routes falls under similar category. The same module structure is to be followed inside **components**, **redux**, **style** which contains related content modulewise.

## Styles

We are using `.scss` to style this application. We emphasize not to use inline as much possible and use class instead. Module structure should be followed to create a `.scss` file for a component.
### example of styles for **auth** module

```
src
├─ styles                    # Application-wide styles (generally settings)
│  ├─ main.scss               # Imports all scss form the diffrent modules (i.e. 'import 'auth/index.scss'')
│  └─ auth                    # Contains scss for the respective modules
│     ├─ index.scss           # Import all scss files for this module (i.e. login.scss, forgotPassword.scss, logout.scss ) │and also define common styles here
│     ├─ login.scss           # Define styles for login container and its successive components
│     ├─ forgotPassword.scss  # Define styles for forgot password container and its successive components
│     └─ logout.scss          # Define styles for logout container and its successive components

```
### example of styles for **auth** module

To add a class to `.scss`, first we create the same module stucture to which we are supposed to write a class.
Lets take example to add some style to login page. If `.scss` for login doesn't exist than we create it `style/auth/login.scss`. Find the location carefully because it defines the relation between `.scss` and your components. Here in example `style` is the directory which contains all `.scss` files. `auth` is the module directory, it contains all `.scss` files for `auth` module. `login.scss` indicates that it contains all styles for login page.

`style/auth/login.scss`

```
/*
  Styles only for container login and its successive components
*/

.logo-container {
  background-color: #284665;
  padding: 30px 40px 30px 40px;
  width: 300px;
  margin-left: 5px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  padding-bottom: 20px;
}
```

`style/auth/forgotPassword.scss`

```
/*
  Styles only for container forgotPassword and its successive components
*/

.btn-flat {
  background: #284665;
}
```

`style/auth/logout.scss`

```
/*
  Styles only for container logout and its successive components
*/
.timeline {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

module directory also contains one `index.scss` file which imports all `.scss` files for respective module (here `auth` module in example). This `index.scss` file also contains styles that is common to that module.



```
/*
  `style/auth/index.scss`
  Imports .scss files for this module
*/
@import "login";
@import "logout";
@import "forgotPassword";

/*
  Styles common to all container of this modules and its successive components
*/
.input-auth-padding {
  padding: 5px;
}
```
### main.scss

There would be a `main.scss` file which import scss files from all modules. This main.scss file is imported to the project's root file `main.js`. So no need to add any other `scss` file to anywhere in the application but only need to import in `main.scss`.



```
/*
  `style/main.scss`
  Imports index.scss file from the modules
*/
@import "auth/index";
@import "inventory/index";
@import "auth/index";

/*
  style comes here which is common to all modules  
*/
body{
  font-family: "Roboto", "Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
### Cypress Unit Testing

```
It is to test every page(route) as a user by Automation testing.
run test through UI in default browser.

```
